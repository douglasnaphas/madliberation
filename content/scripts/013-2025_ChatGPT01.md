# Mad Liberation 2025

## Let the Liberation Begin!

{{ A boisterous opening line // Hello, my magical people! //  // Welcome to the wildest seder in town! }}. Gather close, for tonight we celebrate {{ a made-up holiday name // FreedomFest 5784 // This night is known as __ // Matzo-Palooza }}—better known as Passover. It's time to cast off your {{ outdated item or idea // fax machines // // sensible footwear }} and embrace your inner wanderer.

We have gathered, like the Israelites before us, for {{ a reason for gathering // snacks, stories, and slightly too much wine // We gather tonight for _. // serious semi-silly reflection }}. So loosen your belts, open your minds, and prepare for a journey through time, spirit, and {{ a random object // antique lamps //  // rubber chickens }}.

## Matzah > Bread

Let’s talk about {{ a carbohydrate-related philosophy // unleavened minimalism //  // carbs without drama }}. During Passover, we eat matzah because {{ reason matzah is important // there was no time to wait for the dough to rise // We eat matzah because _. // it’s what all the cool prophets are doing }}.

Some say that matzah is the {{ symbolic meaning of matzah // bread of humility // Matzah is _. // ancient granola bar of truth }}.

Others say it is {{ an insult to matzah // flat and flavorless despair // I call matzah _. // the roof shingle of snacks }}.

No matter what you call it, we embrace it. Like {{ something you reluctantly embrace // a hug from a wet dog //  // your cousin's pyramid scheme pitch }}.

## Passover Icebreaker!

Let’s go around the table and share: “What’s something you’ve let go of this year, just like we let go of hametz?”

[[ Take turns responding. ]]

Now, let’s go around again: “What’s something you want to embrace this year, like we embrace matzah and maybe each other?”

[[ Take turns again. ]]

## The Seder Playlist

Here’s tonight’s playlist, no skips allowed.

1. Kadeish – {{ Verb ending in -ish // refresh // We will _. // reestablish }} your soul with wine

2. Urchatz – {{ Another way to say “wash up” // scrub-a-dub-dub // Let’s _. // cleanse like queens }}

3. Karpas – Dip something green in saltwater and {{ something dramatic // release your inner amphibian //  // cry the tears of 1,000 onions }}

4. Yachatz – Break the matzah and try not to {{ exaggerated verb // explode from anticipation //  // summon the snack spirits }}

...and so on. You know the drill. Or if you don’t, fake it ‘til you {{ verb // shake it // You gotta _. // afikoman it }}.

## First Glass of Wine

We begin with the first glass of wine, because {{ reason we drink wine on Passover // it helps us tell stories better // We drink wine tonight because _. // it gets the seder rolling }}.

Let’s bless:

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ri hagafen.

Sip. Sip. Savor. Now {{ silly command // tell your wine it’s doing a great job //  // swirl dramatically and sigh like an old poet }}.

## The Four Questions (Remix)

Tonight is different. Yes, because we {{ unusual seder behavior // wear mismatched socks in solidarity // We are _. // chanting in pirate voices }}, but also because the youngest among us will now ask questions.

[[ Youngest person reads or everyone chants the Ma Nishtana together. ]]

And now, translation, Mad Lib style:

Why do we eat {{ adjective // crunchy // This bread is _. // confusing }} bread?

Why dip veggies in {{ dramatic liquid // mermaid tears // We dip in _. // salty seafoam }}?

Why do we {{ something weird you do at the seder // lean dramatically to the left // On Passover, we _. // engage in grape-related rituals }}?

And most importantly, why so many questions?

## Share-a-freedom

Let’s go around and each name a freedom we’re grateful for this year.

"I’m grateful for {{ a freedom or right // the right to dance like nobody’s watching // I’m grateful for _. // bathroom breaks at work }}."

[[ Take turns responding. Bonus points for flair. ]]

## Plague Parade

Let’s list some plagues of modern life. Everyone shout one out. I’ll start:

“{{ something mildly annoying // group texts with 38 people // // people who chew loudly }}!”

[[ Go around the room. Get weird. Get real. Get cathartic. ]]

And now, take a drop of wine for each one. Because even modern woes deserve ancient rituals.

## Hiding the Afikoman

We now hide the Afikoman, because no seder is complete without {{ a mystery item // a missing triangle of crunchy mystery // What’s missing? Oh, it’s _. // the ancient snack scavenger hunt }}.

[[ Someone hides the Afikoman. Everyone else looks away and pretends not to peek. ]]

## It’s Dinner-ish Time!

But wait! We say blessings first.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, הַמּוֹצִיא לֶחֶם מִן הָאָרֶץ

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, hamotzi lechem min ha-aretz.

Eat your {{ food item that’s not kosher for Passover // spaghetti squash // This year I brought _. // forbidden latkes }}, or don’t. Munch responsibly.

# {{ Page }}

## Elijah Watch

Pour Elijah a glass, and leave the door open, unless you live in {{ dangerous place // a haunted raccoon alley // I would never leave my door open in _. // Philadelphia }}.

Then whisper your wish for the year:

"I wish for {{ a future hope // more spontaneous dance parties // My wish is for _. // good health and great leftovers }}."

## Final Blessing

One last cup. You made it. Mazel Tov.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ri hagafen.

Repeat after me:

“Next year in {{ a dream destination // a yurt in Big Sur //  // a future free from typos }}!”

L'shana haba'ah b'{{ mad lib location // a more just and joyful world //  // a slightly bigger apartment }}!
